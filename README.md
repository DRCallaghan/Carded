## Installation 
First, clone down this repository into the folder of your choice in your command line. After cloning, open up the terminal and run `npm install` to install all of the npm packages. Next run `npm run develop` to start up the application.

## Usage 
After starting up the application, you will be directed to the home page. Once on the home page, click the `sign up` button to create a new account or the `log in` button if you already have an existing account. On the sign up page, fill out all of the information to then be redirected to your personal profile page. From here, you will either create a team by clicking the `Add Team` button or  wait to be added to a team from your team manager. If you add a team, you will fill out your team's information and click `Save Changes`. This will reload your profile page and add the team to the `Teams` dropdown. Click on the `Teams` dropdown and click on your team name to be redirected to your team page. On the team page, you can add members to your team by clicking the `Add a Team Member` button and filling out the team member's information. When a manager adds a member, that member's profile page will then be populated with the business card for that team.
